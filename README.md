# Highest-Rank-Card-Game


We are going to use .NET Properties wherever possible.
We are going to add exceptions to our POCOs that check for invalid parameters.
We are going to use Collections instead of arrays
We are going to change the game so that each round has one winner (i.e., no more ties).
We are going to use an abstract Player class to create 4 different kinds of players - each with a different strategy for picking a card to play.


In this game the difference is
"HighestPlayer" always picks the "highest" card in their hand.
"LowestPlayer" always picks the "lowest" card in their hand.
"MiddlePlayer" always picks the "middle" card in their hand.
